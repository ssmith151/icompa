Interactive Comparison Analysis

**4. Aim:**

Majority of data analysis consists of comparison of
samples and to identify elements that are common in these
samples. Although sounds trivial, comparison and visualization of
a certain category is time consuming and requires repetitive
tasks. In addition, comparing the common elements of two
samples to other remaining ones creates complexity to the
process. Creating a visual tool to identify common patterns or
irregularities in terms of common and different elements in the
data would help researchers to get an overall view of what they
have in their hand, quickly.

**5. Project description:**

Venn diagrams are very useful tools to show the common and
different elements in two samples. Since they get complex after 3
samples, an approach would be creating a diagonal
representation of samples and showing each comparison pair in
corresponding row and column. Also, on-site filtering enables to
decrease complexity through hiding unnecessary information on
screen. Implementing front-end with Javascript for practical tools
and communication through AJAX in the backend to achieve
complex analysis improves user experience as wells as reducing
the complexity of the tool. A practical approach would be
implementing front-end with D3 and back-end with Django in
addition to creating the communication through D3â€™s request
method.
